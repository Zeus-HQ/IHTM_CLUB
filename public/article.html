                    <h2>A word from a head figure in the program: </h2>
                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        Dear students, colleagues, and all community of the University of Prince Mugrin! On behalf of TRSDC Education team, I would like to congratulate and extend my warmest wishes to you all on the beginning of your second academic semester. 
I welcome you, our new comers as well as our returning students, to your bright journey of education! 
 
You’ve all proven how unstoppable you are, despite all challenges and abnormalities that 2020 has thrown our way. 
“Hard times and tough circumstances separate those who are good from those who are great”. 
To all of our students, always remember that you are the pioneers in the hospitality program at UPM, it is you who will pave the way for others to follow. We wish you all continued success in your educational journey and in the years to come. To all of our colleagues at UPM, your exceptional commitment and dedication is what’s helping make this program successful and thriving. 
 
It is worth reminding all of us that hospitality shapes people’s experiences and the experiences of all tourists that will visit our country.  
“It’s not your customer’s job to remember you, it is your obligation and responsibility to make sure they do not have a chance to forget you”. – Patricia Frap 
I hope you all continue to cherish this learning path and make the most out of it. 
 <br/><br/>
—Zehar Filemban <br/>
(Learning & Development Director at TRSDC)

Therefore, I called them and scheduled a meeting and went there to meet Mr. Omar Hussain (the CEO at that time), we agreed to work on Takki as our project.

                    <h2>Students Spotlight: </h2>

                    <div>
                        <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> 
                            Shefaa Alferaidi, aged 28 from  Medina, grew up in a family that  encouraged her to be responsible  and well educated. 
    She got accepted into Taibah  
    University, and was thrown into the  Chemistry Dpt., despite it not being  any of her preferred majors. It was  an endless road with no way out but  
    forward, so she settled for the curve ball that was thrown at her and  received a Bachelor’s degree in  Chemistry. Unfortunately, there was  a rarity in jobs related to her major,  and thus she was unable find a job. With no other choice, she was  forced to stay at home. But it was  time spent wisely, as Shefaa did not  waste a single second of it. She took  tons of courses and started her  online business providing purchase  services from international sites. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Sometime after that, an opportunity  arose to work as an admin in a  private school, and one she did not  let pass. Whilst working, she joined  the Education Evaluation Authority  as a supervisor of national tests for  a short while.  
As fate would have it, after two  
years of working at the school,  Shefaa would come to receive a  promotion as manager of the school.  And as manager, she was able to  organize many events alongside the  authority to hire proficient teachers,  all the while receiving extra income.  For the time she worked at the  school, Shefaa thoroughly enjoyed  her job. 
But it was unfortunate that the owner  of the school was more interested in  the material aspect of things and not  the development of his employees  
and faculty 
A year later when it all seemed to  come to an end, Shefaa tried to  hang on as much as she was able ,  before resigning in order to pay dues  to her employees, who numbered  more than twenty.  Yet that wasn't the end of her  journey, she participated in Wateen  blood donation campaigns and  became commissioned in Medina at  that time. As time went on, she  grabbed on to every passing  
 opportunity to improve and develop  her skills. 
Shefaa had the chance to be one of  the representatives of The Chamber  of Commerce at the Medina  Shopping Festival. Soon after, she got accepted in the scholarship of  the Red Sea Development  company.

                        Shurayrah is the hub island of The Red Sea Project on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. With a natural dolphin shape, the island is one of 92 in our archipelago, which is home to the world's fourth largest barrier reef system, untouched corals and a significant number of endangered species. 
                        
                        We appointed renowned British architects Foster + Partners to design all 11 unique resorts on Shurayrah. Referred to as "Coral Bloom", the designs are sure to give future guests a barefoot luxury experience like no other place on earth. The Shurayrah resorts make up the majority of the 16 hotels in phase one of the Project, due to open in 2023. 
                        
                        From a remarkable vision to a groundbreaking reality, work is well underway on Shurayrah Island as the world’s most ambitious regenerative tourism development takes shape.

                    <h2>Story of the Issue: </h2>

                    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                        Nawaf Al Mutairi talks about his journey in the Hospitality & Tourism industry  
                        Mr. Al Mutairi began his career in May 2015, despite the fact that he was studying Mechanical  
                        Engineering at that time, it did not stop him from standing out among his colleagues in Anwar Al Medina Movenpick Hotel. He admitted that he faced many struggles at first, but as soon as he was able to reconcile between his bachelor major and his career in hospitality, there were no further obstacles in his path to success. Mr. Autairi has stated that time management is what enabled him to launch in with confidence. He started his journey as a receptionist and climbed the ladder of success until he was promoted to duty manager in 2018. Between those two positions, he was able to gain experience in almost everything in relation the ‘front-of-house’ department. He also that he aspires to take on more, due to the massive evolution of tourism in Saudi Arabia. He expects a bright future for Saudi Arabia in the Hospitality Industry with the launching all the major projects, such as The Red Sea Project, Neom and Al Qiddiya. Within the next 3 to 5 years, Saudi Arabia will not be limited to religious tourism, as it will attract more local and international tourists. 
                        On a personal level and from his own experience, he has stated that he felt delighted to be working with Saudi partners and colleagues, and as he referred to them ad "the national wealth". He describes males as hard workers and mentioned that adding the female component enhanced the value of the industry, especially in customers service.  
                        In addition, Mr. Al Mutairi said that patience and self-control are key in the field, and will be helpful with clients and employees, alongside body language and communication skills, especially with co-workers. 
                        He said: “Good relations between colleagues will facilitate the work between departments.” Regarding the work environment, Mr. Al Mutairi gave us some golden advice from his personal experience, “As future stars in the Hospitality Industry, you must be prepared at all times, to face work stress and expect the worst, which will increase your promptitude and your ability to  handle all matters”. For instance, if you have a birthday in one room and a death case in another one, you must split between both of them by giving each guest the kind of care that they need. You have to train yourself to acquire the skill of poker face. 
                        Mr. Al Mutairi has emphasized on the importance of combining work experience with the academic knowledge, which will always make you a better candidate.

Excellent students, well done, keep fighting for your future and NEVER give up. </p>
